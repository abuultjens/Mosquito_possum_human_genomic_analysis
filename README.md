# Mozzie_possum_human_gnomic_analysis
```Genomic analysis of mosquito, possum and human derived M. ulcerans genomes

This is the tree that was used:
37-VIC_POSSUM-DMG2300866_mincov-1_MOZZIE-DMG2212098-DMG2301551_mincov-1_ONLY_mapped-reads_FastTree-ML.nwk_fofn.txt
37-VIC_POSSUM-DMG2300866_mincov-1_MOZZIE-DMG2212098-DMG2301551_mincov-1_ONLY_mapped-reads_fofn.txt
There are 22 core SNPs among these isolates.

This is just the 36 VIC, without the possum and the mozzie seqs:
36-VIC_fofn.txt
Then there are 117 core SNPs (36-VIC.tab).
95 core SNPs are lost through the inclusion of the seqcap datasets.

36-VIC_W-possum-DMG2300866
122 SNPs

36-VIC_W-possum-DMG2300867
108 SNPs

When including just the 36-VIC and the two possum seqcap:
37-VIC_POSSUM-DMG2300866-DMG2300867_fofn.txt
37-VIC_POSSUM-DMG2300866-DMG2300867.tab 
There are 98 SNPs.
